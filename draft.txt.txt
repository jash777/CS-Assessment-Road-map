                                NETWORK PENTEST METHODOLOGY                                                                                                                                  




Step 1 : Identify live hosts

Ping
Hping
Nmap
Step 2 : Identify OS type

Nmap
Xprobe2
Banner grabbing using telnet, nc (netcat)


Step 3 : Port scan

Nmap full SYN scan with verbose mode and service detection and disabling ping scan. Export normal and greppable output for future use.
nmap -Pn -p- -sV X.X.X.X -v -sS -oG nmap_grepable_SYN -oN nmap_normal_SYN
Nmap top 1000 UDP scan with verbose mode and service detection and disabling ping scan. Export normal and greppable output for future use.
nmap -Pn -top-ports=1000 -sV X.X.X.X -v -sS -oG nmap_grepable_UDP -oN     nmap_normal_UDP
Nmap Full port scan identifying any weak algos and ciphers in SSH and SSL. Export normal and greppable output for future use.
nmap -Pn -A -T4 -vv --script ssh2-enum-algos --script ssl-enum-ciphers <Target List>


Step 4 : Use Nessus

Following things to be looked in the Nessus policy before scan is run:

DoS disabled
Enable TCP and UDP scan
Plugins are updated as per defined plugin policy
Step 5 : Use NMAP scanner on specific open ports

port 22 (SSH) is open and you want to run all scripts pertaining to SSH then use below command:

Nmap -Pn -sS -p22 --script ssh* -v


Step 6 : Audit SSL (Use testssl.sh or TestSSLMaster.exe for SSL related vulnerability mentioned here for quicker results)

Use openssl, sslyze tools to find below issues within SSL.
Self-signed certificate
SSL version 2 and 3 detection
Weak hashing algorithm
Use of RC4 and CBC ciphers
Logjam issue
Sweet32 issue
Certificate expiry
Openssl ChangeCipherSec issue
POODLE vulnerability
Openssl heartbleed issue
Lucky 13 and Beast Issue



Step 7 : Check for default passwords in server/device/service documentation

Lets say during your port scan or VA you found some services running on the server for example: cisco, brocade fabric OS, sonic firewall, apache tomcat manager. Then for these services Google what are the default configuration administrative username and password. Try those in your login and check your luck.
