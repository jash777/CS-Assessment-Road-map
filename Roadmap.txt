### Cybersecurity Assessment Roadmap

#### 1. Pre-Assessment Planning
- **Objective:** Define the scope and objectives of the assessment.
- **Actions:**
  - Identify and select systems, networks, and data for assessment.
  - Choose appropriate tools based on the assessment scope.
  - Install and configure the following tools on the assessment machine:
    - **Nmap:** Network scanner.
    - **OpenVAS:** Comprehensive network scanner.
    - **Nikto:** Web application scanner.
    - **Burp Suite:** Web application scanner.
    - **Nessus:** Vulnerability scanner.
    - **Wazuh:** Monitoring tool.
    - **Snort:** Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS).
    - **Suricata:** IDS/IPS.
    - **OpenDLP:** Data Loss Prevention tool.
    - **ClamAV:** Malware scanner.

#### 2. Network Vulnerability Scanning
- **Objective:** Identify potential vulnerabilities in internal and external networks.
- **Actions:**
  - Use **Nmap** for internal network scanning:
    - Command examples: `nmap -sV -oN result.txt -T4 192.168.1.0/24`, `nmap -sn -oN result.txt 192.168.1.0/24`.
  - Use **OpenVAS** for detailed network scans.

#### 3. Web Application Scanning
- **Objective:** Discover vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Actions:**
  - Utilize **Burp Suite** for in-depth web application scanning and analysis.
  - Deploy **Nikto** for additional web application vulnerability scanning:
    - Command example: `nikto -Format html -o report.html -h http://www.example.com/`.

#### 4. Monitoring and Vulnerability Management
- **Objective:** Continuously monitor networks and manage vulnerabilities.
- **Actions:**
  - Implement **Wazuh** for network monitoring and compliance reporting.

#### 5. Analysis and Reporting
- **Objective:** Analyze data collected from scans and monitoring, and compile findings.
- **Actions:**
  - Review and analyze reports from network scans, web application scans, and monitoring tools.
  - Compile findings into a comprehensive report, highlighting key vulnerabilities and providing improvement recommendations.

#### 6. Recommendation Planning
- **Objective:** Develop a remediation plan based on the assessment findings.
- **Actions:**
  - Develop a remediation plan addressing identified vulnerabilities.
  - Prioritize actions based on the risk level of the vulnerabilities.

#### 7. Documentation and Compliance
- **Objective:** Maintain thorough records and ensure adherence to compliance standards.
- **Actions:**
  - Keep detailed documentation of all assessments, findings, and remediation actions.
  - Regularly review security measures for compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.
